average_time.py

just run it. It will ask for how big the average queue should be, how many pings until average is printed, and how long between pings in secons

dump_analysis.py 

IMPORTANT, DO THIS BEFORE RUNNING 'sudo dump_analysis.sh'

run 'ip route get 10.1.5.2'
then get the interface (its gonna look like 'eth0' just 'eth' + a number)

then go into dump_analysis.sh and 
set interface to whatever interface you got for 'ip route get'

dont run that directly. run 'sudo dump_analysis.sh'. it currently collects everything correctly, however I am having a bit of trouble figuring
out how to display it neatly and without having to stop the program
